Add this custom repository to HACS
Download the `Revogi Petoneer Water Fountain` integration in HACS

Click add integration in the Integrations section, and select `Revogi Petoneer Water Fountain`

The integration adds a single sensor, with an overall state of the water percentage, and a number of attributes, a switch to turn the fountain on and off, and a binary sensor based around consumables alert.

Important Note: This is for fountains that use the Fresco Pro app, not the Tuya Cloud based Petoneer app.

##TODO

Add a way to reset the consumables
